# Grokking algorithms with Rust

This repository contains Rust implementations of several algorithms from awesome "Grokking Algorithms" book,
written by Aditya Bhargava. It doesn't have any practical value and was created with only one goal - have
some Rust and algorithmic practice. Although, maybe someone can find these implementations useful.
